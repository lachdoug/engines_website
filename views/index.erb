          <h4>Installing Engines</h4>
          <p>Use a dedicated computer with at least 2GB RAM and 40GB available disk space.</p>
          <p>The machine should be running a fresh and updated version of Linux
            (<a href="http://www.ubuntu.com/download/server"
                target= "engines_linux">Ubuntu Server 16.04 LTS</a> is recommended).</p>
          <p>Login to your computer and enter...</p>
          <pre>curl engines.org/install | bash</pre>
          <p>You may need to enter your computer's admin password to start the installation.
            You will be prompted to set a timezone.</p>
          <p>The installer will take about half an hour to run.</p>
          <p>The URL that you will use to access your
             Engines web interface will appear at the end of the process.</p>
          <p>Open a web browser, enter the URL and complete the setup wizard. You'll then be ready to install applications.</p>

          <p>A blueprint is a manifest that allows Engines to install and manage software.</p>
          <p>A blueprint.json specifies details such as source file locations, environment, replacement strings, templated files, service configurations, and schedules.
            <a href="https://github.com/EnginesBlueprints/Owncloud_new/blob/master/blueprint.json">Here is an example.</a></p>
          <p>You can publish your blueprint in a libray to give an app store-like installation experience, or you can provide a URL to the blueprint for side-loading of software.</p>
